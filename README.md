### Businesses Owned by Government Affiliates 


# Why Does This List Matter	

## If you're an everyday Ghanaian, your options for pushing back against our governement's mismanagement of state resources, increased taxation and more are limited. As we've seen time and again, even peaceful protests are unlawfully quashed to instill fear and discourage mass organizing/advocacy. But you can choose where you spend, and we can organize a criticial mass of us to stop willingly spending money at establishments that are owned/operated by government appointees/affiliates.
